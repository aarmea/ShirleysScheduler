Shirley's Scheduler
=====================

Term Project for Web Science

-------

This part of the readme will be dedicated to links/notes about guidelines of the project, from the base up this project needs to follow some simple guidelines. 

==============================

The first key thing about the project is deciding on a style guide, this includes fonts, colors, font sizes, icons, table styles, link styles, almost any feature of the website will need to have a guidline attached to it so that the style can be easily defined, here is a link to an article about laying out a style guide for a project: [Link Here](http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2014/02/17/effective-style-guides-with-adobe-fireworks/)
We will also be using SemVer v2.0.0 to declare to the developers what version the web application is currently at (note that once we start breaking down features we will use branches to keep track of beta builds and also the last (X.Y.Z) X version previous to the current working one : [SemVer](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Also we will be using some of the design principles presented in this repository also hosted on github, North will be used to help define the project a s awhole during every step, essentially a guideline for the process of developing the web application:[North: Designing Projects](https://github.com/Snugug/north).
